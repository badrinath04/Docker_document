Push your images to private (local) repository :
      
       You might have the need to have your own private repositories. You may not 
       want to host the repositories on Docker Hub. For this, there is a repository
       container itself from Docker. 
      
       (i)Use the Docker run command to download the private registry. This can be done using the following command.
               $ docker pull registry:2
          ‘registry’ is the container managed by Docker which can be used to host private Repositories.

       (ii) And it is better to mount a volume which keeps a backup of all your pushed Images. 
            So that if the registry container is stopped it will restore all your pushed images when ever it restarts.
                $ mkdir registry_backup
                $ cd registry_backup
                  
            and  run the registry image along with mounting.
                $   docker run -d -p  9999:5000 -v  $(pwd)/:/var/lib/registry registry:2
            Let’s do a ‘docker ps’ to see that the registry container is indeed running.Now your private registry setup is done.


       (iii)Now let’s tag one of our existing images (let’s take centos) so that we can push it to our local repository.
              $ docker tag centos  localhost:9999/centos

       (iv)Now let’s use the Docker push command to push the repository to our private Repository.
              $ docker push localhost:9999/centos 

       (v)You can share your private registry image to others also.To do that go to the file  /etc/docker/daemon.json and add this line.
            
            {
		           "insecure-registries" : [ "<your_IP_address>:9999" ]
             }

        And in the system from where you need to pull this private image also add the 
        above line in /etc/docker/daemon.json  in its system.(The ipaddress which is 
        mentioning here should be the image holder’s  ipaddress.)

         (vi) After that you can pull that private image with the following command.
               $ docker pull <ipaddressofimageholder>:9999/centos
