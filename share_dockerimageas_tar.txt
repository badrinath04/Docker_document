Share image via .tar file :

         (i) Sometimes I want to save a docker image and then use it on another computer
             without going through the hassle of uploading it to dockerhub or private registry.
             
         (ii) Docker images aren’t really stored as files that you can just grab and move to
                another computer .But you can save and then load the images like this:
          
               If you want to save the image as a tar archive, using docker save -o:
                 $ docker save -o  abcd.tar  <image_name:tag>
                 
         (iii) Then copy the adcd.tar file into another computer and load there :
                 $ docker load abcd.tar
                 
         (iv)Run “ docker images ” . It will show up in your docker images list .
