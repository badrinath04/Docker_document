# How to install Docker :
   $ sudo apt update

#If you find any problem in the above command you will have to run an installation script provided by Docker.
   $ sudo apt-get install wget
   $ wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh

#If you want to be able to run Docker containers as your user, not only as root, you should add yourself to the group called docker using the following command.
#(To access without sudo)
   $ sudo groupadd docker
   $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
Then youâ€™ll want to log out and then log back in for the changes to take effect.
