Push your images to docker hub :

    (1)Create a account in dockerhub (hub.docker.com). And remember your username and password.

    (2)Now go to terminal and run the command “docker login”  And then enter your username and password to login.

    (3)Then tag your image to a new name such that it should be in the format like  {username}/{imagename:tag}
         $ docker tag  your_imagename:tag   your_username/imagename:tag

     (4)Now push your image to docker hub.
         $ docker push  your_username/imagename:tag

     (5) Now the docker hub has your image.
     (6) You can also push your same image with different tag.So that it will push into same image repository with different tag. 
         And then the repository contains different images with same imagename and different tags.
         You call pull the image by differentiating the tag.

     (7) Now the person who needs to pull that image can pull with the below Command.
             $ docker  pull  <usernameofimageholder>/<imagename:tag>
